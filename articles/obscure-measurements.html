            <p>We all know inches and centimeters, but history is full of strange units that refuse to die. Here are five you might encounter in books or specialized fields.</p>
            <h2>1. The Fathom (6 Feet)</h2>
            <p>Used primarily for water depth. If a sailor says the water is "5 fathoms deep," it means 30 feet. Originally, it was the span of a man's outstretched arms.</p>
            <h2>2. The Furlong (660 Feet)</h2>
            <p>Still used in horse racing. It equals 1/8th of a mile. It originated as the length of a furrow in a plowed field that an ox team could plow without resting.</p>
            <h2>3. The Hand (4 Inches)</h2>
            <p>Used exclusively for measuring the height of horses. A horse that is "15 hands" is 60 inches tall at the shoulder.</p>
            <h2>4. The Cord (128 Cubic Feet)</h2>
            <p>Used for firewood. It describes a stack of wood 4 feet high, 4 feet wide, and 8 feet long.</p>
            <h2>5. The Smoot (5 Feet, 7 Inches)</h2>
            <p>A humorous unit created by MIT students in the 1950s who used their friend, Oliver Smoot, to measure the Harvard Bridge. It is still used to mark the bridge today!</p>
