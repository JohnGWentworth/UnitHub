            <p>Before the late 1700s, France was a mess of measurement. One town used a "foot" that was 12 inches, the next town used a "foot" that was 11 inches. Merchants were constantly cheating peasants.</p>
            <h2>The Revolution</h2>
            <p>When the French Revolution toppled the monarchy in 1789, they wanted to wipe out all traces of the old regime—including the chaotic measurements. They sought a system based on nature, not kings.</p>
            <h2>Defining the Meter</h2>
            <p>Scientists defined the meter as one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator, passing through Paris. It took astronomers seven years to measure this arc of the Earth. While they made a slight error (the Earth isn't a perfect sphere), the Meter was born, and with it, the decimal-based system we use today.</p>
